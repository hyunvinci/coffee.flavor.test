<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The original coffee flavour wheel was created by the <a href="http://www.scaa.org/">Specialty Coffee Association of
    America</a> in poster form but it appears in various places on the Web. <a
        href="http://www.gourmet-coffee.com/how-to-cup-coffee.html">Rogers Gourmet Coffee &amp; Tea Market</a> seems to
    have the most information about its origin:
<blockquote>
    â€¦a flavor wheel created in 1997 by the Specialty Coffee Association of America, the Colombian Coffee Federation, and
    Jean Lenoir. It's part of the poster called, "The Coffee Tasters' Flavor Wheel" that you can buy on the SCAA
    website.
